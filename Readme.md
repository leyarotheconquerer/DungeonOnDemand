Cat summoning game

Spend money to buy more atractions
More cats earn you more money
Cat cafe

Stat craziness
Not sure where the interest curve lies
What does the UI even look like?


Summon starships to combat?
Summon starships to mine?

You are a space station
You need resources to grow
But you don't have any miners
Send out signals to gather miners
Pay them to gather resources for you
Use those resources to buy more modules
To call more miners

Essentially a clicker game

Must kill the enemy

Defeat the enemy to keep the benefit

### Convoy/Shipping Company

* Summoning escorts to protect your convoy
* More escorts the more protection
* Push your luck type game
* Like a tower defense?
* But you're the convoy
* And your escorts protect you

* You choose your cargo
* You choose your escorts
* You have limited reputation to summon escorts
* Different cargos have different danger levels

* Themed after WW2
* Themed after modern cargo ships attacked by terrorists
* Themed after space ships going between star systems

* 2d map
* 3d map

* Requires enemies
* Slow player ship questions whether or not it's fun to play
* Make summoning happen during convoy?
* Incentivize summoning more than one at a time to avoid the one at a time approach

* Escorts can be distracting
* Or can be attackers
* Not both
* Or else just expensive, if both

### Dungeon On Demand

Dungeon crawler/hack-'n-slash
Monsters don't spawn
You summon them
But you don't control what spawns
Only when it spawns
To get through certain doors or to disable certain traps
You need to kill a certain number of monsters
Multiple monsters might spawn
Or only one might spawn

Requires combat
Monsters of various types
	- Archers
	- Zombies/Goblins
	- Orcs
You are a knight?
Ranger?

They summon around you
So open areas may help
Constricted areas may hurt
But archers are easier to kill in constricted areas
Display what will spawn next like tetris?
Don't tell how many?

Generally increase over time?

Must kill things near the door or trap to unlock
